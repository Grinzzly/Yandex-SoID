# Solution

Well, it is looks like I am ahead of myself. In fact as a solution I needed to combine [1st task](../Integrated%20Task) 
and the [2nd](../Layout%20Task) as a server and client parts of the whole web-application. But as far as I didn't know 
this before start working on previous task it is looks like I already implemented this functionality. So this brings as 
to the next paragraph:

# Usage 

## Installation

Go to the [Backend task](../Integrated%20Task) and launch it.

Go to the [Frontend task](../Layout%20Task) and launch it.

open http://localhost:8080
