# Description

I know that JS is not about games and far away from game development in general. But,
as far as I am concerned, every time you build a to-do list app, a puppy dies. That is
the main reason why I have decided to start writing games on JS and using frameworks of JS itself
and gave games as an alternate assignment within the confines of courses where I
am appear as a teacher.

# This repo includes the following solutions:

## 1. [Integrated Task](./Integrated%20Task)

# Style

This project uses the [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
for coding style, and is configured for linting using ESLint.
